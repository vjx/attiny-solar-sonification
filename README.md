Solar Cell Sonification with ATtiny
Description

This project uses an ATtiny microcontroller to sonify the output of a solar cell through a buzzer. The system reads the voltage from the solar cell and generates sound based on the energy levels, providing real-time audio feedback.

Features

    Reads analog values from a solar cell.
    Converts voltage readings into sound frequencies.
    Adjustable sound patterns based on energy levels.

Code Overview

The code performs the following tasks:

    Initializes serial communication.
    Reads analog values from the solar cell multiple times to calculate an average.
    Determines the pause duration for the buzzer based on the average reading.
    Generates sound using the tone() function.

Circuit Diagram


Usage

    Connect the solar cell to the analog pin A2 of the ATtiny.
    Connect the buzzer to pin PB3.
    Upload the code to the ATtiny microcontroller.
    Monitor the serial output for average readings and listen to the sound generated by the buzzer.

Requirements

    ATtiny microcontroller
    Buzzer
    Solar cell
    Arduino IDE for programming
